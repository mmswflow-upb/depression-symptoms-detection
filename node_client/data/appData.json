They feel a heavy weight on their chest from the pressure and worry about disappointing their teammates. Nighttime stress impacts their ability to sleep and focus. Despite attempting to ask for help from teammates, they were told to work harder, leaving the user feeling like a \"deadweight.\" They struggle particularly with the documentation involving graphs and data, as well as UI features, and lose concentration frequently. The user feels trapped in a vicious cycle of stress and lack of sleep but hasn't mentioned specific methods they use to manage breaks or refocus."
